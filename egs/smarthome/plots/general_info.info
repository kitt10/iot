The anomaly score of the input samples. The lower, the more abnormal. Negative scores represent outliers, positive scores represent inliers.

Average anomaly score of X of the base classifiers.

The anomaly score of an input sample is computed as the mean anomaly score of the trees in the forest.

The measure of normality of an observation given a tree is the depth of the leaf containing this observation, which is equivalent to the number of splittings required to isolate this point. In case of several observations n_left in the leaf, the average path length of a n_left samples isolation tree is added.
