The bachelor thesis aims to construct several electrical circuits of ESP8266, sensors and lights and develop voice-enabled smart home modules. The first step design a hardware solution and the physical implementation of individual sensors and lights with ESP8266. As next step are ESP8266 programmed and built engine as a software environment for data communication, data storage and voice-enabled modules. Furthermore, a VoiceKit is connected to the engine to allow a user to control modules by voice. The central part of the project is the web page visualizing all states of components, listed voice commands, currently uttered user commands, and graph data from sensors. The outcome of this project is a functional example use of modules in a basic smart home.
