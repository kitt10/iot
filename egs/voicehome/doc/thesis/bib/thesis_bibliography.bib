  abstract = {This review gives a general overview of techniques used in statistical parametric speech synthesis. One instance of these techniques, called hidden Markov model (HMM)-based speech synthesis, has recently been demonstrated to be very effective in synthesizing acceptable speech. This review also contrasts these techniques with the more conventional technique of unit-selection synthesis that has dominated speech synthesis over the last decade. The advantages and drawbacks of statistical parametric synthesis are highlighted and we identify where we expect key developments to appear in the immediate future.}
